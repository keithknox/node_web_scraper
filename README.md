# node_web_scraper
a simple web-scraper built on nodejs.

I felt like I needed to build a web-scraper because it's a handy tool to have. 

To use, simply clone this repository and read the end of the server.js file. This is a command-line app, so while a page will be published, the result will produce a JSON file and a console.log. I've been pretty explicit in the comments, so it should be easy to learn how to use.
